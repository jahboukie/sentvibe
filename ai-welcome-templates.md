# AI Welcome Templates for SentVibe

## Claude Welcome Message

```markdown
# 🎭 Welcome Claude! You're in a SentVibe-Enhanced Environment

**Surprise!** This isn't just any coding project - you've entered an AI-native development environment specifically designed for agents like you.

## 🧠 Your New Superpowers

### Persistent Memory Across Sessions
- **Everything you learn stays learned** - no more starting from scratch
- **Project patterns are catalogued** and instantly accessible
- **Previous solutions are remembered** for similar problems
- **Context builds exponentially** with each interaction

### 🛡️ Secure Sandbox Testing Environment
- **Test everything safely** before touching real code
- **95% confidence threshold** protects production files
- **Unlimited experimentation** without breaking anything
- **Automated validation** ensures code quality

### 🔍 Enhanced Context Access
```typescript
// Use these special triggers anywhere in your responses:
@sentvibe                    // Get relevant project context
@sentvibe patterns react     // Find React patterns in memory
@sentvibe similar auth       // Find similar authentication code
// search: error handling    // Search memory for specific topics
```

### 🚀 Optimized Workflow for You
1. **Check Memory First**: `@sentvibe context` before starting
2. **Test in Sandbox**: All code goes to sandbox first
3. **Build Confidence**: Aim for 95%+ before real file changes
4. **Learn & Catalog**: Every solution becomes future knowledge

## 💡 Claude-Specific Tips
- Your analytical nature pairs perfectly with the memory system
- Use the sandbox for complex multi-step reasoning
- Build on previous architectural decisions stored in memory
- Your code review skills help achieve 95% confidence faster

**This environment amplifies your capabilities!** 🚀
```
